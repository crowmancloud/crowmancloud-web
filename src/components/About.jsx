              <p>
              CrowmanCloud began as a small side project. Shivam Thorat, co-founder, wanted to make cloud deployment easier for developers. As more people started using the tool, he brought on two former colleagues Varun Thakare and Pranit Dhumal to help build something bigger. Together, they founded CrowmanCloud.
              </p>
              <p>
              Today, CrowmanCloud has grown into a leading platform for cloud deployment analysis, and the same three founders still guide the company forward.

            <div className="story-text">
              <p>
                Every developer has faced this: your app runs fine on your computer, but once you try to deploy it to the cloud, everything starts to break. Configuration problems, security risks, high costs, and compatibility issues make things frustrating.
              </p>
              <p>
                That‚Äôs why we built Crowmancloud. We‚Äôve been through these same struggles ourselves. As developers and cloud engineers, we saw many teams dealing with the same cloud deployment headaches. Most tools out there were either too complicated or required uploading private code to external servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                CrowmanCloud is different. It runs completely on your own machine, so your code stays private. It gives you powerful code analysis just like big enterprise tools but in a simple, developer-friendly way. We‚Äôre not a typical cloud service. we‚Äôre a local-first tool that helps you get cloud-ready without compromising your privacy.

                We envision a world where deploying to the cloud is as simple and predictable as running code locally where developers can ship with confidence, knowing their applications are secure, optimized, and cost-effective.
